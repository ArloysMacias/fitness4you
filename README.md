#Fitness4You: An E-commerce site
This e-commerce site is was created as a fourth Mile stone project with Code Institute.
It is a web-based store where users can view and purchase fitness and nutritional supplements as a part of their fitness routine. They can search and filter the offered products dynamically Users can interact with the site as a guest, including purchasing or users can create a profile, log in and interact with the site through his or her own account. This also allows the user to keep track of his or her information and purchase history.

************Have this at all as a seperate readme or just incorporate vision statement with the UX?




##Features
###Existing Features
####Navbar
Each page on the site has the navbar accessible on the very top of the page. In mobile devices it turns into a hamburger menu in the top left corner of the page.

The following options are presented on the navbar when the user is not logged in:
* Home
* Products
* Account (Dropdown: Login / Register)
* Shopping cart (with number indication items inside)

The following options are presented on the navbar when the user is logged in:
* Home
* Products
* Account (Dropdown: My profile / Logout)
* User name
* Shopping cart (with number indication items inside)

The following options are presented on the navbar when a superuser is logged in:
* Home
* Products
* Management (Dropdown: Edit product / Add product)
* Account (Dropdown: My profile / Logout)
* User name
* Shopping cart (with number indication items inside)

####Home Page
Created with the intent on drawing the interest of the user with bold colors and intriguing images. 

* Buttons that makes it easy for the user to create an account, as it directs him or her to the Login/Register page
* A section showing some of the products available for purchase, with clickable links taking the user to the specific product page
* Footer with contact information to the owner of the site

####Product List
#####Product details: 
* Displayed in the product cards are information about each product such as name, brand, price, rating and description. Each product also displays an image which is clickable for an enlarged view.

#####Buttons:
* Each product card has a 'view' button and a 'add-to-cart' button attach to it. Clicking the 'view' button will redirect the user to the specific product page and the 'add-to-cart' button will place the product in the cart, showing a success message when completed.

####Product Page
#####Product details:
* As opposed to the Product list, the Product page displays information about a specific product in a larger view such as name, brand, price, rating and description. Each product also displays an image which is clickable for an enlarged view.

#####Buttons:
* An 'add-to-cart' button will place the product in the cart, showing a success message when completed and a 'continue shopping' button will take the user back to the Product List.

####Register Page
This template is from django's inbuilt allauth.

* The register page allows new users to be added to the database. This consists of a registration form where the user enters the information needed in order to successfully register as a user on the page. When the user clicks 'Sign up' a new user is added into the database.

####Login Page
* When the user click the 'login' button they are redirected to the login page where they have to input user name and password in order to successfully log in. If an incorrect user name or password is entered the page is refreshed, the user is informed and asked to submit again. After successful login the user is redirected to 'Home' page.

####Logout Page
* When the user click on the 'logout' button they are redirected to a confirmation page where the user is asked to confirm if they want to complete the log out. Once logged out the user will be redirected to the 'Home' page.

####Admin Page
* The admin page gives the superuser the option of modifying the products, delete and add new. In the 'Product list' the superuser can view individual products, delete, or modify them with the click of a button. The super user also has an added 'Management' option in the navbar where they can choose 'Add product' or 'Edit product' which takes the superuser to a form where all products can be accessed. 

####Cart Page

* The Cart page displays the shopping cart with the items the user had added previously. It shows the product quantity, individual price, total price and product description. It also allows the user to change the quantity of individual products as well as deleting a product from the cart. If the quantity of an item is reduced to zero it will automatically be removed from the cart. Buttons to continue shopping or to proceed to checkout are displayed. If the user visits their cart but hasn't added any products, they will be informed that their cart is empty and no checkout button will be visible.

####Checkout Page

* The checkout page contains the forms used to insert the user's personal details and to insert payment details. At the bottom of the page is the 'Submit payment' button which will initiate interaction with Stripe API.

####Checkout Successful Page

* If checkout is successful the user will be redirected to the 'Checkout Successful Page' where they will be informed that the payment went through and a confirmation email has been sent to the email provided in the previous form. The user will also see a "receipt" or a complete list showing the order they just placed.

###Features Left to Implement
Without time constraints it would be ideal to make it a bigger project with gym affiliations and facilities. As shown in the original wireframes, this was the idea from the start.
To achieve this the following features would need to be implemented:

* A choice of different training options and classes, both in groups and with a PT
* The option to sign up for a gym membership
* The option for users to leave product reviews
